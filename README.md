**Patent Kinematics** is a data science framework that treats global innovation not as a static count of documents, but as a dynamic physical system. By applying kinematic equations to patent datasets (Google Patents Public Data), this tool generates **Phase Space Trajectories** ($v$ vs $a$) to identify technology lifecycles, hype bubbles, and stagnation points.

## The Concept

Standard patent analysis relies on bar charts (Position $x$). This project calculates the derivatives of innovation to reveal the hidden "forces" driving the market.

| Variable | Physics Analog | Innovation Analog |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Position ($x$)** | Distance Traveled | **Cumulative Knowledge** (Total Patent Families) |
| **Velocity ($v$)** | Speed ($\dot{x}$) | **New Filings per Year** (Market Activity) |
| **Acceleration ($a$)** | Force ($\ddot{x}$) | **Year-over-Year Growth** (Hype / Saturation) |

By plotting **Velocity vs. Acceleration**, we generate a "Hysteresis Loop" that visually distinguishes between a booming technology (top-right quadrant) and a dying one (bottom-right quadrant), even if they have the same number of annual filings.

## Features

* **BigQuery Integration:** SQL queries optimized for the Google Patents Public Dataset (`patents-public-data.patents.publications`).
* **"Unit of Innovation" Logic:** Strictly filters for simple patent families and priority dates to eliminate administrative noise (dupes/continuations).
* **Kinematic Engine:** Python functions to calculate smoothed velocity and acceleration vectors.
* **Unified Dashboard:** Generates 2-panel visualizations:
  * **Panel A (Real Phase Space):** $x$ vs $v$ (The S-Curve Derivative).
  * **Panel B (Lifecycle Phase Space):** $v$ vs $a$ (The Hype Cycle Loop).
* **Lag Correction:** Automatic filtering of the 18-month publication lag to prevent false "crash" signals.
